# Attitude Estimation Using Complimentary Filtering and Callibration

This was the final assignment for my ECE 167: Sensors and Systems course. We used the PIC32MX 320F Microprocessor from Microchip to create a software interface to the {insert sensor name here} sensor. This sensor contained a Magentometer, Accelerometer, and Gyroscope, which were used in compliment to create an Attitude Heading Reference System, i.e. A device to describe the rotation of itself to the Earth. These Devices are commonly found in phones now. The lab covers several ways of filtering raw data these from cheap sensors to get good readings. The two primary techniques were TRIAD filtering and the WABBA Solution.
